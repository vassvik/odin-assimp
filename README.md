# odin-assimp

With a dev console (x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017), with `git` in PATH
```
build_assimp.bat
build_lib.bat
```
then run `main.odin`. Depends on [odin-glfw](https://github.com/vassvik/odin-glfw), [odin-gl](https://github.com/vassvik/odin-gl) and [odin-gl_font](https://github.com/vassvik/odin-gl_font) (which depends on [odin-stb](https://github.com/vassvik/odin-stb)) (all a bit out of date, probably). 

Models paths are hard coded. 

Left and right keys to change models. 

Ctrl, Shift and Alt to change camera speed. 

WASD to move camera. Left click and move to pivot.

Press B to show bounding box.
